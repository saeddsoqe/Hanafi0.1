   2-(Silcon Labs CP210x driver)https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

For MAC
On Mac OS, you need to confirm that MicroBlocks was downloaded from the internet the first time you run it.
1-Right-click on MicroBlocks.app and select "Open" from the menu:
*put photo*
2-Then click the "Open" button in the confirmation dialog:
*put photo* 
3-The dialog box will close. Now, double-click on MicroBlocks.app to open it.

FOR LINUX
On Linux systems, users donâ€™t have access to the USB serial port by default. To fix that, just add yourself to 
the "dialout" group by running this in a terminal:
sudo usermod -G dialout -a `whoami`
Log out and back in to make the change take effect. You should see "dialout" when you list your groups.
